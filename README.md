# ENGG1340 Project: Staff Management System
## Problem Statement
Our staff management system aims to collect and organize our employees' personal information to help our Human Resources Department move, store, or view information about the employee in an efficient way. This way, we are able to keep track of empolyees' performance and roles in our company to ensure that they are working up to standard.

Since we are a small business with only a few employees, our company does not have a proper system that tracks the amount of casual leaves our employees take. However, as a growing company, we want to start **recording their casual leaves** to avoid granting too many or too little casual leaves our staff can take.

## Problem Setting






## **Program Features:**

1. **Create New Employee Record:** Creates a new employee with attributes including employee ID, name, birthday, role, and salary

2. **Search and Delete Employee Records:** Search for and delete an employee via their ID, name, birthday or role

3. **Employee Termination:** Enables the user to select employee’s record for termination and deletes it from the employee records. This record will then be moved into another record of employees who have been terminated/left the company.

4. **Edit Record Details:** Edit the details of an existing employee;

5. **Finding Employees with Certain Amount of Salary:** Users can input a certain amount and search for all employees with a salary higher than or lower than the input

6. **Addition of New Attributes to Existing Employee Record:** User can add user-defined attributes to existing employee records —  the value of a new attribute of the existing employee should be empty or undefined.

7. **Records Remaining Days of Casual Leave:** A record of the number of casual leaves left for the employee will be kept, thus helping the HR/supervisor to approve/disapprove the request of the employee’s request for leave.

8. **User Menu**:  It will show the functions 1-7 and give a short description of what each function does.
