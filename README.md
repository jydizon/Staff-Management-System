# ENGG1340 Project: Staff Management System
## Problem Statement
Our staff management system aims to collect and organize our employees' personal information to help our Human Resources Department move, store, or view information about the employee in an efficient way. This way, we are able to keep track of empolyees' performance and roles in our company to ensure that they are working up to standard.

Since we are a small business with only a few employees, our company does not have a proper system that tracks the amount of casual leaves our employees take. However, as a growing company, we want to start **recording their casual leaves** to avoid granting too many or too little casual leaves our staff can take.
